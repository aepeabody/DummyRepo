What did you guys do this summer?

** Max **
I did not have much of a summer. I took two online summer classes, and worked full time.
I had two weeks where I had time off before this semester started so I went home and spent time with my parents.

This summer, I had the opportunity to intern at Sweetwater. It was a great experience.
I made lots of new connections and friends. I also got to stay at the PFW student housing. 
On weekends, I hung out with my girlfriend Jamie, spent time with my family, and went to church 
with my roommate Ty. It was a great summer overall :)
