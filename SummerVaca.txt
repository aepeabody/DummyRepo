What did you guys do this summer?

Annie Peabody
I went to Florida to visit my dad, he lives really close to the beach so I went swimming and tried not to get sunburnt. I went to visit family in Michigan for a while right before school started and then had to rush home to pack for college and I definitely left a lot of important stuff behind by accident. Tried to relax and take it easy this summer and stayed home when I could.
