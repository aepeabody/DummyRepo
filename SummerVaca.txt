What did you guys do this summer?

My summer was kept pretty busy. I got married on June 5th, so naturally there was a lot to do in prepartaion. I kept myself busy by
making sure the details of the wedding were in order. Before the wedding, I was repairing/upgrading the house that were live in now.
Frankly, it was in shambles so there was a lot of work to do. I painted it, inside and out. changed out sinks, got a washer and dryer,
and bunches of other things that I wont go into detail for.
So basically, I was getting ready to married life all summer. :]

I did not have much of a summer. I took two online summer classes, and worked full time.
I had two weeks where I had time off before this semester started so I went home and spent time with my parents.

This summer, I had the opportunity to intern at Sweetwater. It was a great experience.
I made lots of new connections and friends. I also got to stay at the PFW student housing. 
On weekends, I hung out with my girlfriend Jamie, spent time with my family, and went to church 
with my roommate Ty. It was a great summer overall :)
