What did you guys do this summer?



My summer was kept pretty busy. I got married on June 5th, so naturally there was a lot to do in prepartaion. I kept myself busy by
making sure the details of the wedding were in order. Before the wedding, I was repairing/upgrading the house that were live in now.
Frankly, it was in shambles so there was a lot of work to do. I painted it, inside and out. changed out sinks, got a washer and dryer,
and bunches of other things that I wont go into detail for.
So basically, I was getting ready to married life all summer. :]
